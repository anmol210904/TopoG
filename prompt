title - Real time Network Mapper and Altert Generator (rNAG)
so i have created a networking tool which is a realtime natwork mapper what exectly it is doing is if you are going to connect it to a node in the network its going to show you the whole network in graphical formats with verticies being the network devices(which support cdp so every layer 2 and layer 3 device is going to be shown there) and edges being the actual poiny yo point connection if they are configured correctly.  so how it works is it send a telnet/ssh to the default gateway of the connected endpoint and then runs sh cdp neighbour to get the information about neighbouring devices and then pings neighbouring devices to get there ip address of the connected interfaces now connects to that roouter to get its loopback address and then repeats the same on the router 
example router a having interface ip 10.1.1.1/24 and loopback adress 1.1.1.1
router 2 having inteface ip 10.1.1.2/24 and loopback adress 2.2.2.2
now if i am connected to 1.1.1.1 using ssh i will run sh cdp neighbour 
it will show me neighbouring ips 10.1.1.2
i will ssh to 10.1.1.2 this way i will get to know that this link 10.1.1.1 to 10.2.2.2 is working and then i will extract its loopback which will be 2.2.2.2 
this way i have explore routers and switches in network 
i am using bfs 
the final output is a graph 

the overall complexity of exploring the whole grapgh is o(n+v)
the amount of traffic generated by this in network is constant that is everytime a telnet connection will be there 
since i using cdp the detected of any device being removed is immidicate but any device being added is equal to update time of cdp which is 180 seconds which means 3 minutes 

so with this all being said it continusly scans the network and tell us the realtime snerio of the network and generate alerts on any changes being made
